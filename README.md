FIG is an open-source toolkit that transforms your unstructured and structured data into **actionable knowledge graphs**, then serves them through a hallucination-resistant chatbot using graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). Designed for developers who want:

‚úì **Precision over probability** - Every answer grounded in your explicit knowledge graph  
‚úì **Zero ETL graph construction** - Start with tables (CSV/Excel), soon PDFs & databases  
‚úì **Cypher-as-a-Service** - Natural language to optimized graph queries via LLM translation

> **Early Access Alert**  
> This is a proof-of-concept release (pre-alpha). Core features work, but expect rough edges.  
> Current focus: Table ‚Üí Graph ‚Üí Chat pipeline ‚Ä¢ Roadmap includes PDF/Parquet support

## Quick Start (2-Minute Setup)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fig.git
cd fig
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the interface at http://localhost:3000 and

### Example Usage
1. Go to "Schema" Page, open the "Schema Assistant" and input the following prompt:
```
Tell me about the relationship between "Customer" and "Order"
```
2. Go to "Sources" Page, upload the CSV files in the example data folder.
3. For each source, click the "Ingest" button to build the graph.
4. Go to "Graph" Page to see the graph.
5. Go to "Playground" Page to prompt the graph.
6. Go to "Servers" Page to see the OpenAI compatible API.

### üìä **Graph Studio**: _Visualize ‚Ä¢ Edit ‚Ä¢ Refine_  
- **Live Graph Visualization**: Explore nodes/relationships in an interactive canvas  
- **Precise Graph Editing**: Directly modify node properties, relationship weights, and metadata

### üß† **Schema Designer**: _Ontology Engineering Meets LLMs_  
- **Drag-and-Drop Ontology Builder**: Create node/relationship types using visual workflows  
- **AI-Assisted Schema Refinement**: Chat with embedded LLM ("Should 'Customer' inherit from 'Organization'?")  

### üì• **Data Sources Hub**:  _Controlled Ingestion Pipeline_  
- **Multi-Source Support**: Allow structured, unstructure, static, and live data sources to be ingested into the graph.
- **Precise Editing**: Modify imported nodes/relationships in spreadsheet-like interfaces  
- **Source Tracking**: Audit which source contributed each graph element.

### ü§ñ **Cypher Playground**  
- **System Prompt Crafting**: Guide LLM's Cypher generation ("Prioritize shortest-path queries") with a system prompt.
- **Test before release**: Side-by-side natural language ‚Üî generated Cypher comparison, execution time metrics, result previews before deploying as OpenAI compatible API.

### üåê **Deployment Servers**  
- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Drop-in replacement for existing chatbot applications(\`/v1/chat/completions\`)  
- **Raw Graph Connections**: Bolt protocol support for Neo4j/Tigris direct access (WIP)
- **MCP Server**: Integrate with your own agent through Model Context Protocol. (WIP)  


## Roadmap: What's Cooking? üî•
Data Source Ingestion:
- [ ]  PDF Support: Extract structured entity & relationshipdata from PDFs.
- [ ]  Database Integration: Connect directly to existing databases.
- [ ]  Parquet Files: Handle large datasets efficiently.

Server Deployment:
- [ ]  Raw Graph DB Connections: Access your graph without intermediaries.
- [ ]  MCP Server: Add Model Context Protocol for better integration with agent ecosystems.

General Features:
- [ ]  Model Selection for agents: Use your preferred LLM (Ollama, Gemini, Claude, Groq, etc.) for agents
- [ ]  Import and export graph as RDF / OWL / JSON.
